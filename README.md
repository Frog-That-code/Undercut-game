# Undercut-game
(CODE MIGHT HAVE BUGS)
A game based of a game from the book math games with bad drawings.
RULES OF THE GAME:
 Each player chooses a number 1-5. If the two numbers don't differ by 1, then each player adds their own number to their score. If the two numbers differ by 1, then the player with the lower number adds both numbers to his or her score; the player with the higher number gets nothing. First player to have 11 more points than the other person wins. 
My code has a variation were instead of each player adding their own numbers, the person with the higher number subtracts the lower number from it.(idk why I did this)
